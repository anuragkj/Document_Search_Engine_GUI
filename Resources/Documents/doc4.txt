Apple is sometimes red, sometimes green. There is a red one fallen near the green car. 
The car is parked near a red bus. Green is a nice color. Leaves are green, so are traffic lights when they
say go. I like to drink green tea. Green tea is a refreshing beverage. I am waiting for my bus at the bus stop.
I hope the bus arrives in time. Bus service is a mass-transit system. There comes the bus; I will get on to the bus
and leave.
