This is red. Said Green. Red is supposed to be 7 times here in this doc.
Do you have any orange? asked the artist. Bus is repeated many times here. Give me a green apple. Apples are  
delicious fruits, red in color some times, some times green. A bus can be red too. Are you waiting for a bus?
Do you know how to drive a bus? Bus service is a mass-transit system. I am waiting for an Orange colored bus. 
The orange Sun will turn red before setting. Orange is a beautiful color. Red is, too. Orange is a fruit too.
