There will be no more red, in this document. There will be plenty of orange though. Orange is a color,
as well as a fruit. Have you eaten an orange? Sunset is orange in color! My bike is orange in color. Riding
a bike is fun. Bike is a environmentally friendly vehicle. Bike riding is a good exercise. Enough about bike.
Back to bus; bus service is a mass-transit system. I am waiting for my bus at the bus-stop. Can you see the bus?
It is orange in color. Did I tell you that sunset is orange in color? Orange; it is.
